# Heart-Disease-Classification
Testing the effectiveness of various classification algorithms on predicting heart disease.

##### Abstract
This project focuses on the classification of heart disease by using several machine learning algorithms. The analysis implements Python and Python libraries including these algorithms to come up with a model that best predicts the diagnosis. Through the investigation, we will find which algorithm most effectively and consistently predicts the presence of heart disease. 

We will examine 11 out of 76 total attributes, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc.
